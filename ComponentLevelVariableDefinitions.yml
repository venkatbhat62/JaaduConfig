### Contains Component level variable definitions at platform or application level
### Include this file in component specific environment spec file using below syntax   
### {% include "ComponentLevelVariableDefinitions.yml" %} 
#}
Component:
  ### using regular expression syntax, specify how to find component name of the application of platform
  ###  so that component specific variable values can be derived run time
  ### AppConfig naming convention - <platform><componentName>.<subsystemName>.<configFileName>[.<version>].yml where
  ###   <platform>  - keep this same as platform name defined before for this environment
  ###   <componentName> - abbreviated component name
  ###   <subsystemName> - Apps for main application, DB for Database configurations, OS for OS configurations
  ###   [.<version>] - this application version will be appended run time to derive the config file to be used
  ###           based on current application release installed on that host.
  ###        If the system is Apps, command specified under CommandToGetAppVersion will be used 
  ###           run time to derive the application version
  ###        For OS subsystem, command specified under CommandToGetOSVersion is used to derive the version
  ###        For DB subsystem, command specified under CommandToGetDBVersion is used to derive the version
  ###        This field is optional
  ###   <operation> - compare, conn, license, test, stats... 
  ###           each operation will have it's own spec file per platform, per component.
  ###           It is feasible to maintain that per subsystem also.
  ###
  ### Examples:
  ###    Platform1APP.Apps.compare.yml, Platform1APP.OS.compare.yml, Platform1APP.DB.compare.yml
  ###    Platform1APP.Apps.compare.2.yml, Platform1APP.OS.compare.8.yml, Platform1APP.DB.compare.10.yml
  ###    Platform1APP.Apps.conn.yml, Platform1APP.OS.conn.yml, Platform1APP.DB.conn.yml

  ### Component spec is read when current hostname matches to the hostname regular expression defined under component name.
  ### Include only the component type used while defining the hostname, not any environment indicator used as part of the hostname
  ### Use wild card for site and environment portion of the hostname. If no such hostname convention exist, list all the
  ###   possible hostnames under all environments for that component type here so that the component spec applies to all hosts of 
  ###   that component type. 
  ### Use environment indicator like d or dv for DEV, t or st, i or it for test, ut, u for UAT, p or pd for production environment
  ###   in environment section so that variables can be defined that applies to all components in that environment.
  ### Specification under environment overrides the spec under component.
